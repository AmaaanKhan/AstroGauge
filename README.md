# AstroGauge

> **Abstract** : AstroGauge is an IoT-based weather station designed for astrophotography enthusiasts. Built using a NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor), LDR (light pollution sensor), a breadboard, and jumper wires, the device collects real-time environmental data, including temperature, humidity, and light intensity. This data is sent via Wi-Fi to a Java-based mobile app, which also fetches cloud cover information from an API and allows users to input telescope specifications. The app processes all inputs to calculate and display a 1â€“10 grading system, indicating how favorable the conditions are for astrophotography, empowering users to capture the perfect shot under optimal conditions.
